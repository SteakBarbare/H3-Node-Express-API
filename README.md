# BackExample

This is a simple Node Js, MySQL Express API made for back-end & fullstack classes.

## Setup

First, you have to create at the root folder a new file named:

> config.json

Then, inside this file, add your connection variables. If in local, you should have something like this (windows):

`{
"dbConfig": {
"host": "localhost",
"user": "root",
"password": "",
"database": "databasename"
}
}`
